## configParsers:
This module is able to read specific configuration files and represent that content as a go struct.

    ### gtm_conf.go
        Has the model and parser in the same file. Uses mapstructure.Decode to map struct to kv extracted data.

    ### pg_ident_conf.go
        Has model and parser with it. Tracks invalid entries as well.

    ### pghba_conf.go
        Has model and parser.

----
    ### pgxc_ctl_model.go
        Holds the model. Has 2 models, one, the original is flat with an implict indexed link reference between nodes.
        Then the second one that has an explicit reference between components to make the actual struct.

    ### pgxc_ctl.go
        Parses the file content and fills the flat struct, then loops over the flat struct and builds the proper
        go struct.
